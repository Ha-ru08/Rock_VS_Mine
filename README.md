# Rock_VS_Mine

## The abstract of our project as follows:

#### This is the  "Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction". This project is build to perform the Rock Vs mine prediction if the object is a rock or an explosive mine using sonar  data under the water. It helps to predict ships, submarine  whether it is a Rock or Mine in the ocean. This work is also concerned with a process of distinguishing  between metal cylinder (mines) and materials that have a cylindrical shape (rocks) by usingsonar images or signals

## Classification Models
